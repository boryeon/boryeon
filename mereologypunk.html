        <p>Whereas gaskets fill gaps in physical seams, dithering deals with bumpiness of digital data. Dithering is a data processing method for solving aliasing that occurs when sampling video and audio, by adding noise to remove noise. However, human perception sometimes perceives a signal as continuous and smooth even when it has not been dithered, that is, has not tightened with a gasket. In order to prevent the perceptual leakage that interferes with continuity illusion, the human audiovisual temporarily stops updating the visual data or listens to the intermittent sound as a continuous sound. At this moment, Un always leaks a corner of the perception in order to amplify the misconceptions and illusions that constitute the fictional continuity in a junky world where everything can be split infinitely and thus will be filled with infinite small stairs. In this form, U the universal is not the sum of its parts, but a part of another U of the nth naive set, which is the larger whole. A spectrum is a part of a broader spectrum that has it as their part. What is needed is not only the recognition that the world is made up of many invisible parts but also the recognition that ‘this (secondary) world' is made up of other parts of the invisible world.</p>
        <p>The exponential expansion of the possible world is revealed most secularly in the imagination of the TEOTWAWKI, the end of the world as we know it, as a certain point in the future when the value of what is scarce at present time collapses due to hyperinflation, or vice versa. However, rebuilding in this ragged world is once again the will to statistics that determine whether a hair of a person falling on the floor is a man's or a woman's, through the prior probability of p(m):p(f). In order to quantize it again, we will need Xenology to collapse the shape of both the anthropomorphic other who deserve to be welcomed and aliens who invade the earth. All four seasons contain Un as their subset. The Spring contains spring-summer-autumn-winter, the Summer contains spring-summer-autumn-winter, the Autumn contains spring-summer-autumn-winter, and the Winter contains spring-summer-autumn-winter. As a subset, each season itself constitutes Un.</p>
